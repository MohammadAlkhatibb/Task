- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
z-score is how many standard deviations the value away from the mean of set of values. We use z score to make comparing different things possible by putting them all on smae scale.
min-max to scale the data of an attribute so that is falls in a smaller range, from 0 to 1. 
These normalization methods will make us able to model data, which would help in many applications like data mining and extract meaning from it.
```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
It is a process of checking a small piece of code called units. we use it to test the applications and its results.
```
- What is the IDE did you use?
```
I have used InteliJ
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
java.util for using an Arrays class and Lists, in addition to write a data into file.
java.math to use arithmetic functions.
```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
I have faced many difficulties most of them related to precise digits of numbers and rounding issues.
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```
No, I did not.
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
This task enhanced my understanding of classes and interfaces and how Important a cleaning code is.
I have read about z-score and normalization and some statistics aspects.
